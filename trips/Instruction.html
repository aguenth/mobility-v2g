<div>

We now ask you to create a trip diary of all the trips you usually took on <b>each day of the week last year in August and September</b>.<br>
To start, please read the instructions below.<br>

</div>
<br>

On the following pages, please provide the following details about the trips you took <b>with your electric vehicle </b>:<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>Where you went <b>(destination)</b></li>
    <li>When you started the trip <b>(start time)</b></li>
<li>How many kilometers you drove <b>(distance)</b></li>
<li>How long the trip took in minutes <b>(duration)</b></li></ul>

<br>
Trips you might have usually taken with a different car are not relevant for this trip diary. <br><br>

For each day, please indicate where you started the day with your electric car (e.g. at home), and where you went from there. The last trip of the day might then be a trip back home. If you did not take any trips on a day, please select "Home" for the starting and the end location of the day.
