We now ask you to create a trip diary of all the trips you usually took on <b>each day of the week last year in August and September</b>.<br>
To start, please read the instructions below.<br>

</div>
<br>

On the following pages, please provide information about the trips you took <b>with your electric vehicle </b>on each day of the week.
<br><br>These details include:
<ul>
    <li>where you went,</li>
    <li>when you started the trip, </li>
<li>how many kilometers your drove </li>
<li>and how long it took in minutes.</li></ul>

<br>
Trips you may have taken with a different car are not relevant for this trip diary. <br><br>

For each day, please indicate where you started the day with your electric car (e.g. at home), and where you went from there. The last trip of the day might then be a trip back home.
